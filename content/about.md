Hey! I'm **Harsh**, an engineering undergrad based in India.

I'm also a game maker, ~~game player~~ gamer, binge reader, hobbyist artist, and a daydreamer. 

I've consistently found joy in creative projects. Sketching, crafting, origami, you get the idea. Gadgets and tech have always fascinated me. And ever since I learnt to code, I've been keen on making things with it. Particularly video games.

This tiny corner of the internet serves as a place where I can share my life experiences, game dev learnings, bite-sized technical tutorials and whatever else I feel like writing about.

Here's what I'm up to [now ->](/now)

Want to say hello? DM me on [Twitter/X](https://x.com/_TheLetterIsH/) or connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harshvalaki/).

> My name means 'happiness' in several Indian languages.

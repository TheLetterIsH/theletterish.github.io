## Sometimes...

Sometimes, things go south.

Sometimes, you think it'll take 3 months to make a full video game.

And sometimes, you realize how wrong you were about that.

Oh also, sometimes, you end up making an entire shop for your game.

## Buiding a shop

It was not hard to build the shop. Well, it was kinda hard but only because I didn't know what I was doing.

It was my first time working with Godot Control nodes. They're very intuitive to use once you figure out what each one does.

Overall, Godot gets a 10/10 for the ease of UI creation.

At first the shop was just supposed to have three cards, out of which the player could buy one. But I quickly realized that this was rather limiting.

I also had to display the current loadout of the player. The current stage the player was at, the amount of gold they had and a few handy buttons.

So, after lots and lots of iterating, I ended up with this lovely shop.

## Systems

I also had to work on some other core game systems for saving and scene transitions.

Now, if you've ever had to make your own sav--

*Plugins*.

I used plugins.

Okay, it's not cheating! I'm here to make a video game. I don't want to reinvent the wheel when some cool people have already made amazing plugins as solutions to the problems that I'm having.

*Ahem*. It's called strategic use of time and effort.

## The End

All of this took wayyy longer than it should have. It's not even funny how much time I've wasted.

And well, that's actually all I've got to show in this devlog.

With all of the core systems done. I'll be moving on to the content creation.

First up, in the list comes the 'weapon system'.

Until next time!

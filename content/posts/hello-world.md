## First ever blog post

*Ahem*, welcome.

I'm Harsh and this is, as mentioned above, my first ever blog post. *Like ever*.

On this site, I'll likely post whenever I feel like it. But to keep to a schedule of some sort -- a post ~~a week~~ every two weeks should do.

At least, that's the plan.

~~I have a feeling I'll find this site barren and postless in just a month's time.~~

My [posts](/posts/) will be about game dev or anything else that I find (mildly) interesting.

Here, you can also find some [projects](/projects/) I've worked on.

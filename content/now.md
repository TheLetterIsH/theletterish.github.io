`[~]$ whatisbrodoing`

### College

I'm currently pursuing my BE in Information Science / Technology.\
I'm in my pre-final year of college.

*drowns in assignments*

### Game Dev

When I'm not drowning in lots of unnecessary college work, I make games.

I'm actually working on a new game right now -- [Lucky Loadout](https://github.com/TheLetterIsH/Lucky-Loadout)!

I use the [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) game engine as my primary game making tool.\
I've also got ample experience with [Unity](https://unity.com/).

Occasionally, I post some of my creative process on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@TheLetterIsH/).\
I'd like to make that more consistent this year.

### LeetCode

Sometimes, I delve into solving [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/TheLetterIsH/) questions. ~~I'm terrible at it though~~.

### Hobbies

I like reading.

I'm reading [The Wandering Inn](https://wanderinginn.com/) right now. It's a high fantasy isekai story and it has quickly become one of my all time favourites.

I also like drawing but... I haven't drawn in a *long long* time.\
One day perhaps!

### Other Plans

Sometime in the near future, I'd also like to take a dive at building mobile apps or even PWAs.\
Seems like it'd be fun to delve into that side of development as well.

Oh, and I'd also love to be employed. *sniffles*.

### Life

I'm in my pre-final year of college. The last three years have gone by quickly, but it's been a fun journey so far.

### Work

I'm unemployed. But I make games.

I'm actually working on a new game right now -- [Lucky Loadout](https://github.com/TheLetterIsH/Lucky-Loadout)!

I use the [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) game engine as my primary game making tool. I've also got ample experience with [Unity](https://unity.com/).

### Reading

I love reading novels and manga. I'm currently reading:

- [Sakamoto Days](https://www.viz.com/shonenjump/chapters/sakamoto-days) by Yuto Suzuki.
- [The Wandering Inn](https://wanderinginn.com/) by pirateaba.
